When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to make my work public and receive contributions (pull requests) from other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That ensures my commit is small enough and logically complete.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is basically a copy of someone's public repository which you make to your github account. You do so to introduce some changes to the code and work on it all by yourself, separate from the original developer. A clone is also a copy of a repository which you make to your PC. Branches allow you to preserve the main code (master branch), or create a new branch and experiment.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That's the way to merge changes made in the remote repository. By using 'fetch' I can update my local origin/master branch, use 'git diff' to compare changes and then merge two branches together

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git or GitHub collaboration would be much harder. I would have had to use emails and 'track changes' mode in MS Word.
