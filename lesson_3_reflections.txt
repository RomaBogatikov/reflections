When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to make my work public and receive contributions (pull requests) from other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That ensures my commit is small enough and logically complete.
