What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository using "git init" command. An invisible .git directory is created that allows me to utilize version control. The number of initial commits in this repository is 0 and I can see a list of untacked files in this repository by typing "git log"

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a transitional stage showing in what files I introduced changes and want to add them to a repository in a single commit. It offers me an opportunity to commit changes I introduced in multiple files via a single commit.
