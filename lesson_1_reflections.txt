How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Using FC in command line makes it easier to see bugs or typos

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I make some changes that break my code I also have a previos version that worked OK. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you can create a commit manually when you think you have finished the code you want to save. 
    Cons: you can forget to save something

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Changes in multiple files might affect the same program. For example, changes in HTML and CSS files of a single webpage.
